# TODO: Fix Admin Navigation Issue

## Problem
Admin users clicking "Manajemen Materi" menu were being redirected to dashboard instead of the material management page.

## Root Cause
Duplicate route definitions in App.js:
- First route only allowed 'guru' role
- Second route allowed both 'guru' and 'admin' roles
- Since React Router matches the first route, admin users were redirected

## Solution Applied
- Removed duplicate restrictive routes for "/manajemen-materi" and "/manajemen-tugas"
- Kept the combined routes that allow both 'guru' and 'admin' roles

## Files Modified
- e-learning-sma/client/src/App.js

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test admin user login
- [ ] Test navigation to "Manajemen Materi" page
- [ ] Test navigation to "Manajemen Tugas" page
- [ ] Verify guru users can still access these pages
- [ ] Verify siswa users are properly restricted

## Status
- [x] Root cause identified
- [x] Code changes applied
- [ ] Testing completed
