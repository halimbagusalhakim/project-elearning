# Fix Edit User Route Not Found Error

## Problem
- Client makes PUT request to `/admin/users/:id` when editing users from admin panel
- Server returns "Route not found" error
- Missing backend implementation for full user editing

## Solution Implemented
- ✅ Added `updateUser` method to User model (`server/models/User.js`)
- ✅ Added `updateUser` function to adminController (`server/controllers/adminController.js`)
- ✅ Added PUT route `/admin/users/:userId` to adminRoutes (`server/routes/adminRoutes.js`)

## Changes Made
1. **User Model**: Added `updateUser(id, userData)` method to update full user data
2. **Admin Controller**: Added `updateUser` function with validation and duplicate checking
3. **Admin Routes**: Added PUT `/admin/users/:userId` route before the role-specific route

## Testing
- Edit user functionality should now work without "Route not found" error
- Validates required fields (username, email, role, nama_lengkap)
- Checks for duplicate username/email (excluding current user)
- Supports all user fields: username, email, role, nama_lengkap, kelas

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
